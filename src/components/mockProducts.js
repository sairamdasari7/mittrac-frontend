      name: 'Chocolate chip cookies',
      description: 'Skill level: Easy | Prep time: 10 mins | Cook time: 20 mins. A batch of freshly made chocolate chip cookies will beat a pack of shop-bought any day. Just cream the butter and sugar, chuck in the rest of the ingredients and mix – it really is that simple. You can get the kids to help you make them too. Its a good idea to make up a big batch of cookie dough, wrap in cling-film and freeze – then bake up a batch of cookies whenever you fancy them. Adapt the recipe by swapping the chocolate chips for Smarties, white chocolate chunks or even bashed-up Maltesers. And away from the choc, try chopped nuts and fruit, such as raisins or dried apricots. This recipe will help you learn how to adapt your cooking times to achieve your desired effect – if you like your cookies soft and gooey (we recommend this outcome) then bake for slightly less time than if you prefer them crisp and crunchy. Skills gained: Measuring, sifting, kneading, rolling, judging oven times',

      description: 'Skill level: Easy | Prep time: 20 mins | Cook time: 30 mins Smothered with a creamy mash topping and packed full of tender meat and gravy, cottage pie is classic British comfort food at its best. Once you have got to grips with a traditional cottage pie, try adding chilli powder to the mix to spice things up a bit, or Indian spices to turn it into a keema pie. Replacing the beef with lamb transforms the dish into a shepherds pie and you could swap the mash for sweet potato and/or swede or throw some carrots or squash into the mix. Or making a completely vegetarian version with added mixed beans for protein. Skills gained: Sauteing vegetables, browning meat, making mashed and creamed potatoes',

      description: "Skill level: Easy | Prep time: 10 mins | Cook time: 20 mins. This is the most basic, all-in-on cake sponge, the springboard for all other cake recipes, if you like. Containing those mainstays of baking – eggs, flour, sugar, butter – and absolutely nothing else, once you have learnt to make a classic Victoria sandwich, you can go on to add other cakes to your repertoire, whether that be cocoa for a chocolate sponge, lemon or orange for a fruit sponge – you get the idea. The main lesson you need to learn about baking is that it is a science and you have to be pretty precise with your measurements, unlike cooking, where you can freestyle with your ingredients rather more. Once you have mastered a Victoria sponge, have a play around with the recipe with these Victoria sponge recipes with a twist. Skills gained: Measuring, beating, whisking",

      name: 'Lasagne',
      description: 'Skill level: Medium | Prep time: 35 mins | Cook time: 2 hrs. A lasagne is perfect for preparing in advance, in fact it usually tastes better when made the day before as the flavours have had a chance to develop (the same is true of many dishes). The first time you make one, focus on doing the meat sauce first, and then the white sauce, as the multitasking of two sauces on the go might be a bit too much. You can also turn your lasagne into a meat-free feast for the whole family or a healthy option packed with plenty of veggies and much less fat. You could even top with mozzarella balls and pesto for a fancy finish. Skills gained: Making a roux for a classic bechamel sauce, browning meat, cooking pasta sheets',

      description: 'Skill level: Easy | Prep time: 30 mins | Cook time: 20 mins. Everyone should know how to bake a chocolate cake, especially if you have kids in the house, and this one comes to you courtesy of the one and only Queen Bee of baking, Mary Berry. Once you have mastered the recipe, try to experiment. Melted chocolate or cocoa powder make the base of most chocolate cakes so  play around with different varieties of both. Smother your chocolate cake in a  spread like Nutella, melted chocolate or make your own chocolate ganache, top with M&Ms, sprinkle with sugar strands or even turn it into a chocolate fingers cake (shhh, don’t tell anyone, but this is a great way of disguising a less-than-perfect bake). Skills gained: Mixing, making and using icing',

      description: 'Skill level: Easy | Prep time: 10 mins | Cook time: 10 mins. We all need a good stir fry in our cooking arsenal. They are quick and easy to make, great for the whole family and well balanced nutritionally. All you need is some veggies, your favourite meat, some stir-fry sauce (be it soy sauce, black bean or sweet and sour, for example) and last but not least, a wok. Cook your meat first, add in the veggies and sauce and stir until combined and delicious. Chillies, ginger and garlic are your flavour friends here, as is soy sauce. Other sauces, like oyster, Sriracha and even fish sauce work well too, as there are no rules. Serve with noodles or rice. Swap the chicken for different meats such prawns or fresh salmon, or go for a vegan option with some tofu. You can also add more spices to the mix or try a different variety of vegetables.

      name: 'Macaroni cheese',
      description: 'Skill level: Easy | Prep time: 10 mins | Cook time: 32 mins. Packed with a creamy, cheesy sauce and a crunchy topping, macaroni cheese is hard to beat on a cold winters day. Its also an absolute triumph with kids. “A quick and comforting supper. You can serve straight from the pan, or pour into a baking dish and top with breadcrumbs mixed with a little cheese for a nice crunchy topping. I always make a little more cheese sauce than I need and freeze for future mac n cheese dishes, or to spread on top of a lasagne,” says chef Michaela Hanna. You can add in some veggies for a vegetable macaroni cheese – broccoli and cauliflower work well. Or turn it into a lower fat version (because, whatever else it is, mac and cheese is no health food) by swapping cream for reduced-fat creme fraiche or semi skimmed milk, and use reduced fat cheese instead like in our low-calorie macaroni.

      description: "Skill level: Medium | Prep time: 45 mins | Cook time: 1 hr. This recipe teaches you how to make shortcrust pastry, but you can opt for shop bought, which makes life much easier as a novice baker (because, baby steps). Once you have mastered an apple pie, try adding in  other fruits – plums or pears work well, and our particular favourite is a blackberry when they’re in season (around September). You could equally add in dry fruits such as  raisins or sultanas. It’s an idea to experiment with different types of pastry as your topper – puff or filo pastry can be super effective. And then how about you learn how to make your own custard?. Skills gained: Making pastry, stewing fruit",

      description: 'Skill level: Easy | Prep time: 25 mins (plus 2 hrs chilling time). No two cheesecakes are made alike – some can be really simple to make and don’t involve baking, while others will develop those baking skills that little bit further. Once you have mastered the art of making a no-bake and a baked cheesecake, experiment with different flavour combinations like blueberry and chocolate or white chocolate and cream. Try an Easy Malteser cheesecake or have a go at cheesecake cupcakes. Top with fresh berries, curls of chocolate or spoonfuls of whipped cream and – most importantly –  enjoy.

      description: "Skill level: Easy | Prep time: 15 mins | Cook time: 10 mins. An excellent recipe to have under your belt for a mid-week dinner and for getting your kids to eat more fish –  because breadcrumbs always help. This recipe uses salmon, so a good source of omega 3 fatty acids for all the family, and is made super tasty with lemon zest, Parmesan and spring onions. You could add capers, too, to this or any other fish – cod and haddock are good white fish alternatives, and smoked haddock adds a different dimension (excellent served with a poached egg on a bed of spinach). Tuna is a good option too, and try adding spices - a few pinches of Cajun seasoning, for example, will give your fishcakes zing. Be sure to have a lemon to hand to squeeze over once they are cooked. Skills gained: Preparing, coating and cooking fish, shallow frying.",
